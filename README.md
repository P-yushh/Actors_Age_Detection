# Actors Age Detection

## Description
It was the first deep learning competition that I participated in. As it was a beginner-based competition which runs for a long time, I quit when I got in the Top 10 on the leaderboard.
The competition was hosted on Analytics Vidhya.

## Problem Statement
Classify Images of Indian actors into 3 different categories based on their ages, namely, YOUNG, MIDDLE, OLD.

## Knowledge Gained
1. Learnt about KFold and StratifiedKFold splitting.
2. Experimented with different augmentations and their effect on model performance.
3. Tried different architectures like VGGNet, ResNet, DenseNet and EfficientNet.
4. Test Time Augmentations.
5. Ensembling technique to improve generalization.
